    "\n",
    "PyMVPA is designed to be able to easily interface with various libraries and computing environments, these external packages only enhance functionality built into PyMVPA or add a different flavor of some algorithm. The framework has two mandatory dependencies (`SciPy`, `NiBabel`)\n",
    "\n",
    "It requires Python 2.x > 2.7 (2.6 and 2.5 might work as well), `NumPy`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following is a list of packages that provide additional functionality leading to more efficiency when using PyMVPA\n",
    "\n",
    "1. IPython: frontend. The way to use PyMVPA interactively\n",
    "2. FSL: Preprocessing and analysis of (f)MRI data. Provides bindings to FSL output and filetypes (e.g. EV files, estimated motion correction parameters and MELODIC output directories). So for example one can use FLS’s implementation of ICA for data reduction and proceed with analyzing the estimated ICs in PyMVPA. (I installed using the FSL installation script and NeuroDebian package)\n",
    "3. AFNI: Preprocessing and analysis of (f)MRI data. AFNI has the ability to read and write NIFTI files, which easily integrate with PyMVPA (Recommended)\n",
    "4. scikit-learn: large parts of its functionality. PyMVPA can make use of any algorithm that implements the transformer or estimator and predictor API. (Recommended)\n",
    "5. Shogun: various classifiers. Use of several SVM implementations, version from 0.6 (Recommended)\n",
    "6. LIBSVM: fast SVM classifier.  (Recommended)\n",
    "7. R and RPy: more classifiers. Currently PyMVPA provides wrappers around LARS, ElasticNet, and GLMNet R libraries available from CRAN (Recommended)\n",
    "8. matplotlib: Matlab-style plotting library for Python. Allows you to export into a large variety of raster and vector formats (e.g. SVG) and thus produce publication quality figures (Recommended)\n",
    "\n",
    "AT THIS POINT OF THE DOCUMENTATION I INSTALLED DEBIAN ON MY DESKTOP COMPUTER. I HAVE A BOOTABLE CD AND A USB. JUST FOLLOWED THE INSTRUCTIONS IN THIS [WEBSITE](https://pchelp.ricmedia.com/how-to-install-debian-linux/)\n",

    "Throughout the tutorial there will be exercises with tasks that aim to deepen your understanding of a particular problem or to train important skills. Is recommended to run the tutorial code interactively and explore code snippets beyond what is touched in the tutorial. Only the most important aspects will be mentioned and each building block in PyMVPA can be used in more flexible ways than what is shown.\n",

    "Additionally another [tutorial written by the creator of Python](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/), this is a more comprehensive, but also more compressed tutorial that can serve as reference.\n",

    "#### Scientific Computing In Python ####\n",
    "___________________________________\n",
    "To employ Python for scientific computing the `Numpy` package is recommended. PyMVPA makes extensive use of `Numpy` data structures and functions, therefore we recommend you to get familiar with it ([Official website](https://www.numpy.org)).\n",

    "#### Interactive Python Shell ####\n",
    "_____________________________\n",

For a quick introduction into the topic read [Pereira et. al. 2009](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811908012263?via%3Dihub). For the generic reference on machine learning methods we would recommend a great text book [The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference and Prediction](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-0-387-84858-7), which is available free of charge.\n",
